// we pass in localAuth as a middleware fn that will check if the user can log in or not (i did this in server.js)- if they cant, then the middlware handles it and it never gets to the endpoint. Otherwise, they're granted access to the login endpoint, and the middleware gives us a req.user so we can now acccess that and know who's logged in - and assign a token for that user!
